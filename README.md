# Tournament_Management_System

**Tournament Management system** for maintaining sports in a better and easier way.  
Traditionally when a tournament is organized storing and processing of data with paperwork is so difficult.  
For removing this drawbacks we developed this **Tournament Management System** for maintaining sports.  
This project is totally functionalized to organize teams for adding, editing, removing and so on.  
Teams data are managed in a good manner.  
We designed, developed and created database in part by part for handling this project.  
Our main goal is to solve this real life problem more functionally.  


## Objectives of the Project  

* Creating a tournament
* Create new team and add to the table
* Edit existing team from table
* Delete existing team from table
* Display standing table
